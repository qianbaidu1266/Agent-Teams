"""
Peer Handoff Workflow - 蜂群模式（Agent 自主性）
===============================================

模式：START → Router → Agent A → [Agent B → ...] → Finalizer → END

重要：first_owner_router 不是 Supervisor！
- 它只选择第一个 agent
- 不参与后续决策
- agents 自己决定下一步

特点：
- First Owner Router 选择初始 agent（仅一次）
- Agent 执行并自主决定下一步动作
- Agent 可以 handoff 给其他 agent、继续或完成
- 无中央 supervisor - agents 地位平等

Agent 动作：
- continue: 继续当前任务
- handoff: 传递给其他 agent
- complete: 任务完成
- respond_user: 直接响应用户
- block: 无法继续

使用场景：需要灵活协作、动态任务调整、agent 间 handoff

对比其他模式：
- vs supervisor_dynamic: 无中央控制，agent 自主性
- vs planner_executor: 动态 handoff，非顺序
- vs router_specialists: 多 agent，handoff 能力
